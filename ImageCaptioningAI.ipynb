This will serve as a learning experience for me and hopefully for you as well. Ill try to breakdown all the complex terms because first it would mean i truly understood the concepts and second it would make it easier to revise anything incase I forget.\n",

This project will require NLP but also computer vision, I think first I should probably tackle the computer vision part with a **Convolutional Neural Network** and then work on a **transformer model** for the captioning part. Ill start by playing around with the CNN."
